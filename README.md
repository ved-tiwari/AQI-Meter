## Description
> View air quality, pollen, and weather statistics in 190+ countries. Designed to be easy to use for those who are interested in learning the air quality statistics in any city in the world.

## About the project

> As time progresses, our air quality continues to worsen at an ever alarming rate. Many factories and vehicles are emitting thousands of tons of emissions in the air and people > who are living in places with more air pollution are suffering as a result. Myself and many others are concerned about the ongoing air quality issue. I was motivated to create > this project because I noticed that there is not enough consolidated data that presents both pollutants and pollen markers in one app.
